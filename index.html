                Hello, I am Charles Dahill but everybody calls me "Chay" (it's pronounced the same as Che Guevara). I am currently transitioning
                into a career in computer programming. I am finishing up a certificate program in full stack development
                where I have been focusing on javascript, node.js, express.js, react.js, mysql, and mongo. I have also been
                using udemy courses to teach myself other languages such as php, Java, and C#. I love a challenge and have
                been enjoying the mental stimulation that I get from programming. As well as programming, I thouroughly enjoy
                working with computer hardware; I build my own systems and often do repairs for friends and family.  Before
                I decided to become a computer programmer, I spent the past five years as a high school science teacher in
                Phoenix, Arizona. The subjects I taught were Earth Science, Physics, and introductory Chemistry. My education
                degrees include:
                <ul id="education">
                    <li>Certificate in full stack development, University of Arizona</li>
                    <li>M.Ed in Secondary Education, University of Arizona</li>
                    <li>M.A in Museum Studies, New York University</li>
                    <li>B.A in Physics with a minor in Astronomy, University of Arizona</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
